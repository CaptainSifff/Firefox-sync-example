A simple python Firefox Sync (Weave) client.

Forked from https://github.com/iivvoo/Firefox-sync-example

This version prints the browsing history to stdout.

 -t TIME 	print only history since TIME (in unix time), default is to print
		all browsing history
 -d 		keep running and check for new history items every ten minutes
 --help 	for all options

before you use this against Mozilla's own sync server, you should probably check if their
Terms of Services allow this kind of behaviour ( https://services.mozilla.com/tos/ )

Login credentials and encryption key can be either saved in a config file (
~/.firefoxsyncrc , see the sample.config file for the format) or the sync
client will ask for them.
